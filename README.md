## [ThawMaster](https://github.com/ESikich/DailyExperiments/tree/main/ThawMaster)
ThawMaster is a Python program that simulates the time taken for a material to cool to within 1 degree of room temperature, given its initial temperature and the ambient temperature. It uses Newton's law of cooling and is performed for a range of initial and ambient temperatures. The results are plotted as a 3D surface plot and a 2D contour plot.
